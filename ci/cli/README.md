## Options

Options in the CLI allow for dynamic configuration of `starship`. You can specify individual options directly in the command line to fine-tune the behavior of the tool. Alternatively, you can use the `--config` option to specify a YAML configuration file that sets up the initial parameters. If both methods are used, any options provided directly in the command line will override the corresponding settings in the configuration file, giving you the flexibility to customize specific aspects of the deployment without altering the entire configuration.

| Option             | Description                                           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `--config <path>`  | Specify the path to the JSON configuration file containing all settings. |
| `--helmFile <path>`| Specify the path to the Helm file.                    |
| `--helmName <name>`| Specify the Helm release name.                        |
| `--helmRepo <repo>`| Specify the Helm repository.                          |
| `--helmRepoUrl <url>` | Specify the Helm repository URL.                    |
| `--helmChart <chart>` | Specify the Helm chart.                             |
| `--helmVersion <ver>` | Specify the version of the Helm chart.              |
| `--kindCluster <name>` | Specify the name of the Kubernetes kind cluster.   |
| `--verbose`        | Enable verbose output for debugging purposes.         |
| `--curdir <dir>`   | Specify the current working directory of the operation. |
