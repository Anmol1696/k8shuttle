## Using the StarshipClient

The `StarshipClient` simplifies managing Kubernetes resources, specifically tailored for developers working in interchain environments. Below is an example showing how to instantiate the client and use it to manage a Helm deployment:

### Initializing the Client

First, you need to import and initialize the `StarshipClient` with your Helm configuration:

```js
import { StarshipClient } from '@starship-ci/client';

const client = new StarshipClient({
  helmName: 'osmojs',
  helmFile: 'path/to/config.yaml',
  helmRepo: 'starship',
  helmRepoUrl: 'https://cosmology-tech.github.io/starship/',
  helmChart: 'devnet',
  helmVersion: 'v0.1.38'
});
```

### Setting Up and Installing the Chart

After initializing, set up the environment and install the starship helm chart:

```js
// adds helm chart to registry
client.setup();
// installs helm chart
client.deploy();
```

## Starting Port Forwarding

For local development, you might need to forward ports from your Kubernetes pods:

```js
client.startPortForward();
```

## Stopping and Cleaning Up

Once done with development or testing, you can stop the port forwarding and remove the Helm chart:

```js
// stop port forwarding AND
// remove the deployed release from your Kubernetes cluster
client.undeploy();

// remove the helm chart
client.teardown();
```

## Developing


When first cloning the repo:
```
yarn
yarn build
```
