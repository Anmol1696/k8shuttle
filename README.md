Universal interchain development environment in k8s. The vision of this project
is to have a single easy to use developer environment with full testing support
for multichain use cases

## Installation
In order to get started with starship, one needs to install the following
* `kubectl`: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/ (you can use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for simple install)
* `helm`: https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/

## Install

Install the test utilities `starshipjs` and the CLI `@starship-ci/cli`:

```sh
yarn add --dev starshipjs @starship-ci/cli
```

### Recommended Usage üìò

Stay tuned for a `create-cosmos-app` boilerplate! For now, this is the most recommended setup. Consider everything else after this section "advanced setup".

- We recommend studying the [osmojs starship integration](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/tree/main/packages/osmojs/starship) and replicating it.
- Add your configs, similar to how it's done [here](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/tree/main/packages/osmojs/starship/configs)
- Add your workflows for GitHub Actions [like this](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/main/.github/workflows/e2e-tests.yaml)
- Add `yarn starship` commands to your package.json scripts [like this](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/blob/c456184666eda55cd6fee5cd09ba6c05c898d55c/packages/osmojs/package.json#L31-L34)
‚Äî Note the jest configurations in the [osmojs package](https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmojs/tree/main/packages/osmojs)


This will allow you to run `yarn starship` to `start`, `setup`, `deploy`, `stop` and other `starship` commands:

#### Deploying `Starship` üöÄ

```sh
yarn starship start
```

#### Running End-to-End Tests üß™

```sh
# test
yarn starship:test

# watch 
yarn starship:watch
```

#### Teardown üõ†Ô∏è

```sh
# stop ports and delete deployment
yarn starship stop
```
