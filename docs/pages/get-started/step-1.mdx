# **Step 1:** Setup dependencies

_You can skip directly to **TLDR** for the quickest start._

In this step, we will setup the dependencies for our project. We will use
* `kubectl` (you can use [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for simple install)
* `helm`

> Note: For local setup make sure you have docker setup and running. Run `docker ps` to check if docker is running.

## 1.1) Install `starshipjs`

Install the test utilities `starshipjs` and the CI client `@starship-ci/client`:

```sh
npm install -g @starship-ci/cli
```

## 1.1) Setup
Run the following commands to get the dependencies installed.
```sh
starship setup
```

This will fetch all the dependencies and install them in the `~/.local/bin` directory.
Please add it to your `PATH` variable with
```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/.local/bin
```

## 1.2) Manual Installation
If you want to install the dependencies manually, please follow the instructions of each of
the required dependencies
