# Chains YAML Syntax

Here we will go into details of the `chains` top level directive in the Starship config file.

## `name`
Name of the chain, this is used as the `chain-id` of the chain
```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  ...
- name: gaia-2
  ...
- name: juno-1
  ...
```

## `type`
Type of chain is a short hand to use the default key values for a chain found [here](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/blob/main/charts/devnet/values.yaml#L54...#L244)
```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  ...
- name: gaia-2
  type: cosmos
  ...
```

One can overide the default values supported by `defaultChain` by simpliy mentioning it in the chain directive.
Here is how one can set the docker image of the default values
```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/osmosis:v15.0.0
  coins: 100000000000000uosmo
  ...
```

### `type: custom`
Optionally one can define the type to `custom`, and pass all the default params directly into the chain directive. This is useful when one is
trying setup a chain not supported in the `defaultChains`.
```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: custom
  image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/osmosis:v15.1.2-wasmvm1.1.2
  home: /root/.osmosisd
  binary: osmosisd
  prefix: osmo
  denom: uosmo
  coins: 100000000000000uosmo,100000000000000uion
  hdPath: m/44'/118'/0'/0/0
  coinType: 118
  repo: https://github.com/osmosis-labs/osmosis
  ...
```

## `image` (optional)
Already mentioned above, but here we will go deeper into how the docker images are used for the chain. By default this value is taken from
the `type` directive. This is the standard way of running chains at specific versions.

```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  image: "<docker-image>"
  ...
```

> One can use any docker image as long as it follows the following rules:
> * Packages `curl,make,bash,jq,sed`
> * Chain binaries installed in $PATH

We create docker images with this [Dockerfile](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/blob/main/docker/chains/Dockerfile), using Heighliner base
images. All supported docker images can be found [here](https://github.com/orgs/cosmology-tech/packages?repo_name=starship)

## `numValidators`
Number of validators to run for the chain. It must be greater than 1, can go upto as many resources available.

```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  numValidators: 2
```

> Note: The first node spun up is a `genesis` node, which spins up before all other validators. Once the genesis node starts
> then all other validator nodes are spun up simultaneously

If number of validators is more than the mnemonics available in the [`keys.json`](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/blob/main/charts/devnet/configs/keys.json#L9) file
which is 5, then other validators are created with random mnemonic on initialization.

## `ports`
Ports directive in the `chains` directive is used for `kubectl port-forward` forwarding kubernetes service ports to local host.
```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  numValidators: 2
  ports:
    rest: 1317     # Rest endpoint of the Genesis validator node (most used)
    rpc: 26657     # RPC endpoint of the genesis validator node (most used)
    faucet: 8001   # Cosmjs faucet running next to the genesis node (most used)
    exposer: 9090  # Exposer sidecar port (less used)
```

Avialble endpoints for extra services:
* `exposer`: https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/blob/main/proto/exposer/service.proto#L15
* `faucet`: https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/blob/main/packages/faucet/README.md#using-the-faucet

> Note: Make sure the ports are not overlapping in the config file

## `resources` (optional)
Resource directive is something with which you can control how much resources to provide to each of the chain node.
```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  numValidators: 1
  resources:
    cpu: 1       # 1 CPU
    memory: 1Gi  # 1 GB
```

Main benifit of this directive is to closely control the resources provided for each of the validator node.
One can provide fractional cpus and memory as per the resource constraints of the system

Usually when running in the CI or loaclly you can provide partial resources like following:
```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  numValidators: 1
  resources:
    cpu: "0.2"      # 0.2 CPU
    memory: "400M"  # 0.4 GB
```

For more details on the resource directive have a look at [kubernetes resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-cpu)

> Note: If one provides less resources, the devnet will be stable for shorter timeframe. Nodes will start dying or restarting
> We recommend to specify resources as per your requirements

## `faucet` (optional)
Every genesis node runs a [cosmjs faucet](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmjs/tree/main/packages/faucet), by default
setting for faucet [here](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/blob/main/charts/devnet/values.yaml#L32...#L38) but can be
overiden with this directive, specially for compatible cosmjs version with the chain version.

```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  numValidators: 1
  faucet:
    image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/cosmjs-faucet:v0.30.1
    resources:
      cpu: "0.3"
      memory: "600M"
```

## `build` (optional)
With the `build` directive in the chain, one can basically build chain binaries on the fly before starting the chain.
When the directive is `enabled`, then the docker image is set to a [`runner` docker image](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/blob/main/docker/starship/runner/Dockerfile)
which is a basic alpine image with starship dependencies.
```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  numValidators: 2
  build:
    enabled: true
    source: v15.0.0  # can be a tag or a commit or a branch
```
We fetch the source from the `repo` defined in the `defaultChains`.

If you are using the `type: custom`, then you need to specify `repo` directive, from where to get the source.

## `upgrade` (optional)
If you want to perform a software upgrade on a chain, then this directive is here help. This will not perform the chain
upgrade, but prepare the chain nodes to be able to do an actual software upgrade.
```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  type: osmosis
  numValidators: 2
  upgrade:
    enabled: true             # enable the directive
    type: build               # type build specifies, this will be similar to the `build` directive
    genesis: v13.0.0          # current chain version, tag, branch or commit
    upgrades:
      - name: v14             # upgrade proposal name
        version: v14.0.0      # upgrade chain version, tag, branch or commit
      - name: v15
        version: v15.0.0-rc1  # next chain upgrade version
```

We use [cosmovisor](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.47/tooling/cosmovisor)
to run the validators when this directive is enabled, which allows for external software-upgrade-proposal.
