# Basic Configuration

In Starship one can define the infra required with a simple config file. Each of the configuration directive.
Here is a basic example that will spin up:
* 2 chains with 2 validators each
* Hermes relayer between them (by default will create the IBC-transfer ports and channels)
* Explorer instance: ping-pub with the 2 chains configuration
* Registry service: Analogus to cosmos/chain-registry, following the same schemas

```yaml
chains:
  - name: osmosis-1
    type: osmosis
    numValidators: 2
    ports:
      rest: 1313
      rpc: 26653
  - name: gaia-1
    type: cosmos
    numValidators: 2
    ports:
      rest: 1317
      rpc: 26657

relayers:
  - name: osmos-gaia
    type: hermes
    replicas: 1
    chains:
      - osmosis-1
      - gaia-1

explorer:
  enabled: true
  ports:
    rest: 8080

registry:
  enabled: true
  ports:
    rest: 8081
```

Note this is a basic configuration file. We have various other directives and operations we can perform just with
the config file directives that we will go into details into.
