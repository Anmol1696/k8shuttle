# Relayers YAML Syntax

We will go into details of the `relayers` top level directive in the Starship config file.

> Note: By default the `relayers` will open up a `transfer` port

## `name`
Name of the relayer, this is used as a unique identifier for the relayer.
```yaml
relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  ...
```

## `type`
Type of the relayer to spin up. Currently we support:
* [hermes](https://github.com/informalsystems/hermes)
* [ts-relayer](https://github.com/confio/ts-relayer)

```yaml
relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  type: hermes
  ...
- name: ts-relayer-cosmos-juno
  type: ts-relayer
  ...
```

## `image` (optional)
If one wants to use a specific version of the relayer we support,
then it can be mentioned via this image directive.

Supported version of relayers can be found:
* [`hermes` versions](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/pkgs/container/starship%2Fhermes/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged)
* [`ts-relayer` versions](https://github.com/cosmology-tech/starship/pkgs/container/starship%2Fts-relayer/versions?filters%5Bversion_type%5D=tagged)

```yaml
relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  type: hermes
  image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/hermes:1.5.1
  ...
- name: ts-relayer-cosmos-juno
  type: ts-relayer
  image: ghcr.io/cosmology-tech/starship/ts-relayer:0.9.0
  ...
```

## `replicas`
Number of relayers to spin up. Currently we just support 1 replica for now.
```yaml
relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  type: hermes
  replicas: 1
  ...
```

## `chains`
List of chains to connect to each other, via the Relayer.
Must be `name` of chains defined in the `chains` directive.

```yaml
chains:
- name: osmosis-1
  ...
- name: juno-2
  ...
- name: gaia-4
  ...

relayers:
- name: hermes-osmo-juno
  type: hermes
  replicas: 1
  chains:
  - osmosis-1
  - juno-2
- name: ts-relayer-osmo-gaia
  type: ts-relayer
  replicas: 1
  chains:
  - osmosis-1
  - gaia-4
```
