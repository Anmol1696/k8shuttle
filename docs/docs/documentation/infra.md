# Infra

Starship infra is built with kubernetes. Inorder to simulate the cosmos ecosystem, we run multiple type of nodes, all of them in a scalable fashion.

## Design

We support multiple kinds of nodes:

* Chains
  * Cosmoshub
  * Osmosis
  * Persistence
  * Juno
  * Generic Wasmd chain
* IBC relayer
  * TS-relayer
  * Hermes

Soon we will also add ability to add:
